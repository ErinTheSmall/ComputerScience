client vs server-side:

	problem: how to get a single application onto any computer

	compiler vs interpreter:
		
		compilers: compiler for a specific OS
		interpreters: interpret code for most Os's 
		
		interpreters are slower and leave code vulnerable 



web pages are converted to machine code on a target computer using an interpreter
target machine = client 
interprter = browser 


since conversion is carried out on the client side we can call this client-side processing 


NEW PROBLEM:
		secure payment

SOLUTION: 
		server side code


   client[]------request----->[]server
         []<---html+css+js----[]

   client[]------request----->[]server--->php/asp--->html
         []<---html+css=js----[]


js is executed locally however it is not stored when you leave the site:
	cookies can  be used to store data client-side

php/asp can be used to store data in a database

these 2 things can be used to create dynamic webpages (pages that change depending upon user data)
